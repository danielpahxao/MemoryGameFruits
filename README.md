The memory game is a common game played with a set of cards. 
The cards have a pictures on one side and each picture appears on two. 
The game starts with all the cards face down and the player takes turn to turn over two cards.

In my opinion, memory games can help maintain or improve brain health, mainly the short time memory.

The image of the cards were taken of internet through search terms: fruits with eyes.
